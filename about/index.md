I am a machine learning researcher with interests in computer vision and medical applications. I completed my PhD from [**Brandeis** University](http://www.brandeis.edu/), Boston. I have interned at **Microsoft** Research (Redmond), **Qualcomm** Research (San Diego) and **Philips** Research (Cambridge) during the grad school summers. Before joining grad school I was a Senior Systems Engineer at [Infosys Limited](https://www.infosys.com/). I am from Kathmandu, [**Nepal**](https://media.gadventures.com/media-server/image_library/Nepal-Himalaya-Mountains-Annapurna-Pokhara-Prayer-Flags-IS-027332084-Lg-RGB.jpg). Other than research, I love [rock climbing]({{site.baseurl}}/notes/climbing/), [running](https://runkeeper.com/user/kvpaxos/profile), [playing chess]({{site.baseurl}}/notes/chess/) and listening to classical Indian songs.
